<h2>THE BATTLE OF THE WAY.</h2>

<p class="title1"><i>A Lay of Lake-land.</i></p>

<div class="poem width30">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Now, Lake-men, claim your right of way, and see the business
done,</p>
<p>Come with your crowbar, spade, and pick;&mdash;and sure the battle's
won,</p>
<p>For bolts and bars show <span class="smcap">Spedding's</span> race
that you don't care a fig,</p>
<p>And prove that right's no match for might when rallied round
Latrigg."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>So shouted <span class="smcap">Routh-Fitzpatrick</span>, and
Lake-men with a cheer,</p>
<p>To Fawe Park Gates from Keswick's peaceful slopes were drawing
near,</p>
<p>When high upon the topmost wall as if to break the spell,</p>
<p>There uprose the Solicitor of Mrs. <span class="smcap">Spencer
Bell</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>He spoke and as his voice he raised his arms he waved around,</p>
<p>"Beware," he cried, "what you're about, for this is private
ground.</p>
<p>With sundry pains and penalties you'll surely be repaid,</p>
<p>Who dare to-day set hand to move this lawful barricade!"</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>But <span class="smcap">Routh-Fitzpatrick</span> heeded not his
protest, nor replied;</p>
<p>So Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bell's</span> Solicitor, he promptly
stood aside,</p>
<p>And watched the next proceedings with a disapproving frown,</p>
<p>For up went crow-bar, pick, and axe, and gate and bar went
down.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Yes, 'neath the sturdy Lake-men's blows the barriers gave way,</p>
<p>And lo! in rushed the joyous thronging crowd without delay;</p>
<p>And some on foot, and some in drags, and some in waggons
stowed,</p>
<p>Held on their way triumphantly down the disputed road.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>So onward towards Silver Hill advanced the active host,</p>
<p>And cleared each wire fence away, and levelled every post;</p>
<p>And when with crowbar, pick, and axe, they'd made their purpose
plain,</p>
<p>To Nichol Ending they returned in triumph once again.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Then Secretary <span class="smcap">Jenkinson</span> uprose and
spoke a word,</p>
<p>And said how by the sights that day his manly breast was
stirred,</p>
<p>And how that, if on Saturday as they had now begun</p>
<p>They held their own, they might regard the fight already won.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>And then a telegram from Mr. <span class="smcap">Plimsoll</span> he
read out,</p>
<p>The which the Lake-men greeted with a hearty answering shout;</p>
<p>And Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bell's</span> Solicitor retired from
the field,</p>
<p>But with an ugly look that seemed to say, "We'll never yield!"</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>And so commenced the fray that day, and though we know, of
course,</p>
<p>As everybody tells us, there's no remedy in force,</p>
<p>Still, if the Lake-men's pick and axe this matter sets at rest,</p>
<p>We must admit how ills to cure at Keswick they know best.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>But which side wins or loses in the still impending fight,</p>
<p>Whether force of public freedom, or trick of legal right,</p>
<p>The eager world on-looking may have watched a deadlier fray,</p>
<p>But none more keen in contest than the Battle of the Way!</p>

</div>

<p><i>I. S.</i> (<i>soliloquising</i>). Hah! Really reads very well,
<i>very</i> well indeed. Points neatly put, hits smartly delivered!
They shan't call me the "Champion Slugger" for nothing. American
pugilist, named <span class="smcap">Sullivan</span>, original bearer
of that honorific title, I believe. Should like to see
<span class="smcap">Sullivan</span>. A fellow-feeling makes us
wondrous&mdash;curious. <i>Not</i> kind, always, or
<span class="smcap">Joseph</span> and
<span class="smcap">William</span>&mdash;but no matter.</p>

<p>Hm&mdash;m&mdash;m! Hm&mdash;m&mdash;m&mdash;m! Excellent! Sparklers calculated to
illuminate Lewes, startle Sussex, electrify thecountry. Slugging and
sparkling my specialities. One or two decent speakers about; "our
distinguished leader" can&mdash;distinguish, at great length and with
considerable verbosi&mdash;I mean eloquence.
<span class="smcap">Randolph</span> can rattle, and
<span class="smcap">Morley</span> can pound, and
<span class="smcap">Rosebery</span> twitter pleasantly. But they can't
coruscate <i>and</i> crush. The power of the bolt, which at once
shines and smashes, is Jovian&mdash;not Rhodian, as
<span class="smcap">Dizzy</span> once nastily suggested. "My thunder,"
and I'm proud of it.</p>

<p>By the way, wonder what the <i>other</i> "Thunderer" thinks of it.
Touches a tender chord, the chord of memory. Lost chord now, indeed.
But no matter, let's see.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Turns paper.</i></p>

<p>Hm&mdash;m&mdash;m! Hm&mdash;m&mdash;m&mdash;m! Hah! <i>Too</i> bad! "His bludgeon,
or&mdash;considering his present connection&mdash;may we say his shillelagh?"
Tut-tut! The Cloud-Compeller as a bludgeon-man, the Titan-queller
flourishing a blackthorn like a tenth-rate Theseus, a Hibernian
Hercules! Absurd! No sense of keeping whatever. "Swashbuckler," too!
Nasty, and not even new!</p>

<p>As to "beating the big drum in Sussex"&mdash;why, how often have I done
it&mdash;to their delight&mdash;in their own pages! "Travesty of contemporary
history"&mdash;this to their own omniscient
<span class="smcap">Historicus</span>!</p>

<p>Shows the "Champion Slugger" has struck home, though. Your
hard-hitter&mdash;your fellow who smites, as the appreciative rustic
(Sussex man, I wonder?) put it, "blooming hard, blooming high, and
blooming often," generally scores&mdash;even in the cricket-field. I am the
<span class="smcap">Bonnor</span> of debate, the
<span class="smcap">Thornton</span> of the platform. And doesn't the
"Ring" like it?</p>

<p>Knocked holes in the "Jubilee Session," I fancy, "Ignorant people
who mistake the flush of fever for the bloom of health, the torpor of
apoplexy for the tranquillity of sleep," think that blazing
<span class="smcap">Balfour</span> and stertorous
<span class="smcap">Smith</span> are never "a penny the worse" for my
repeated poundings. Pooh! "Salted with fire"&mdash;<i>my</i>
fire&mdash;they&mdash;not being of the indomitable race of
<span class="smcap">Dizzy</span>&mdash;will <i>not</i> "undecaying live"
much longer. I prophesy&mdash;but no, prophecy, <i>private</i> prophecy at
least, is not profitable. Don't suppose a Delphic priest, or even a
Derby tipster ever wasted time in prophesying <i>to himself!</i></p>

<p>Still&mdash;still, <i>if</i> Champion "slugging" combined with
coruscation <i>does</i> lead to Leadership&mdash;as why should it not?&mdash;I
fancy I know some one who will have what the sporting patterers call,
I think, "a look in" one of these days. Parochial shrewdness is all
very well, so is philosophical precision combined with Puritan
fervour. But the "swashing blow" strikes home, and if the Unionist
bucklers are beaten down thereby, let who likes cry "swashbuckler!" As
to "shillelaghs"&mdash;why is not "blackthorns to the front!" the order of
the hour?</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Left smiling.</i></p>

<hr />

<p><span class="smcap">In Troubled Waters.&mdash;Mr. Chamberlain</span> is
being praised in some quarters for saying that we should leave Irish
affairs, and "attend to our own business." The inference seems to be
that "Irish affairs" are <i>not</i> "our business." Is not Ireland as
much a part of the United Kingdom as England, Scotland, or Wales? We
shall be glad of a line from Mr.
<span class="smcap">Chamberlain</span>&mdash;when he gets to his
Fisheries.</p>

<h2>ROBERT AT LILLIE BRIDGE.</h2>

<p>Well, it does seem rayther rum, I confess, but it's nevertheless
true, that hardly nothink of a singlar and xtraordinary charackter
seems to appen in London that I don't seem to be present. In these
dredful dull days, when there ain't not no great dinners a going on,
no not hardly one Livery Company a dining in their Alls of dazzling
light, and the <span class="smcap">Lord Mare</span> hisself a
injoying of his olliday at Pangburn, what is a pore Hed Waiter to do
to wile away a idle hour or 2; so hearing as two of the seven
Champions of England was about to run a race of ever so many hundred
yards in just a few seconds, at Lilly Bridge, me and
<span class="smcap">Brown</span> went there on that now sillybrated
Monday, and saw sich a rewolutionary riot as would have done justice
to old Ireland itself. Determined to be in good time, we went early,
and took up our plaices, and patiently waited. At about 5 o'clock pea.
hem. the two galliant Champions walked on the ground, and took a good
look at it. I didn't think werry much of their pussonal aperance, and
shouldn't a thort as they was Champions if I hadn't bin told, and one
was a good deal older than the other one, which didn't seem quite fare
to me. However, I didn't interfere, as it wasn't no bizziness of mine,
and the two running Champions walked in to dress, or rather praps I
should say, to undress for the race. Harf past 5 came, and no
Champions, and 6 o'clock struck and no Champions, and we began to get
jest a little fidgetty; at a quarter-past 6 a wild roomer spread
around that we was all a going to be sold!</p>

<p>There was about a hundred thowsand on us, more or less, a waiting
patiently and quietly for a sight that thousands had cum hundreds of
miles for to see, and we was told as how as the two galliant Champions
had had a jolly row jest as they was a undressing, and then both on em
dressed themselves again, and set off at their werry best speed, in
quite different and rong directions, and never cum back! At this
howdacious swindle our true British pluck begun for to arise, and we
all with one acord began to shout tout, "Give us back our Money!" As
they didn't do it, we all made a rush to the Pay Places, jest to help
ourselves to our several shillings, but the cowardly money-takers had
bolted with our money!</p>

<p>Then we Great Britains, feeling as we had been hartfully swindled,
rose up in our mighty wroth and wowed wengeance! And wengeance we
took! Some of the leading sperits among us who had come hundreds of
miles to see the Recorder beaten, tho why they wanted to beat him I
coudn't at all understand, shouted out "We'll have sum-think for our
money afore we gos back," and quite right too, if they'd ha' stopped
at the beer and lemonade, and the spunge cakes, at which the first
rush was made, but when it came to destruction and fire and rebellyon,
me and <span class="smcap">Brown</span> withdrawed our countenances
from the hole thing and remembered our duty to our
<span class="smcap">Queen</span> and Country, and seeing as the blue
Gardiens of the Peeple was rayther hard pressed by the raging and
angry Mob, we got two of our friends, as was there, to jine us, and
then them, and me, and <span class="smcap">Brown</span>, thinking as
perhaps a reserve force might be wanted, and out of respect to the
great Country that begot us, and bread us, and eddicated us, we stood
a long ways off and formed ourselves into a reserve Corpse
accordingly, and from there we surweyed all the wild and wicked
proceedings in peace and quietness, and, strange to say, wasn't
wanted after all!</p>

<p>Ah, if a few more of the few respectable-looking gents as was there
had imitated our bold xample, things might have ended werry different
to what they begun, but so it is, the mere mob is jest as easily led
away to do rong as to do rite, it's only the few who has the moral
curridge to judge for theirselves as can stand apart on the roof of a
publichouse, and look down with pitty and contemp on what is quite
beneath 'em.</p>

<p>As I stood a moralising from my exhalted persition, with a glass of
werry nice hot rum and water to keep up my sperrits and keep out the
cold, I coudn't help thinking wot a werry wunderfull chap is the
Brittish Publick when he hasn't noboddy to guide him. In this werry
partickler case, becoz sumbody had bin and robbed 'em all of a
shilling a peace, they sets to work, and not only gobbles up all poor
Mrs. <span class="smcap">King's</span> refreshments, but breaks all
her glasses and things, although she knowed more about it than the
Emperor of <span class="smcap">China</span>, and that coudn't ha' been
werry much, and smashes down all the palings and places, and then sets
'em on fire, altho' they belonged to a Gent who was out of Town miles
and miles away.</p>

<p>Well, I must say that, having in my werry long xperience seen lots
of crowds of all sorts and sizes, for a thorough blackguard set as
doesn't seem to have one single good quality, or, if they has, they
hides it so carefully that not no one can never find it, but who seems
to delight in orful langwidge and senseless mischief, commend me to a
sporting mob in the naybourhood of Lundon; and the less they are
allowed to congregate there, the better for all honest and decent
people.</p>

<h2>SALUBRITIES ABROAD.</h2>

<p class="titleit">(En Route for Home after the Royat Treatment.)</p>

<p>At Geneva I meet an old friend, one of the heartiest men I've ever
known and one of the best. He is delighted, really delighted, at our
accidental meeting. I am for going on, but he will not hear of it.</p>

<p>"I know the place," says he, cheerily, with a wink and a nudge,
"and I'll take you about."</p>

<p>What a wink it is! and what a nudge! So full of humorous
appreciation of life and character. Such a knowing
not-to-be-done-by-anyone sort of wink. And the nudge is intended to
draw your attention to the wink and emphasise it.
<span class="smcap">John Birley</span> is the frankest, openest,
freest-and-easiest of men, with a boundless capacity for enjoyment,
the strongest sympathies with suffering, and of a reverential grateful
spirit that thanks Heaven for all bounties, and accepts misfortunes
and sorrows as kindly reminders from Providence that the misfortunes
and sorrows of others have to be considered and relieved, and again he
thanks Heaven for having put it into his power to relieve them. His
chief enjoyment is in giving pleasure to others. The most selfish
would gain some good from contact with <span class="smcap">John
Birley</span>; and the craftiest, to whom it might occur to make
<span class="smcap">John Birley's</span> acquaintance for the sake of
what he could make out of him or by him, would soon discover his
error, and would be informed that he stood detected, very clearly,
plainly, and straightly, not by anything that <span class="smcap">John
Birley</span> would say, but he would have it intimated to him beyond
possibility of mistake by <span class="smcap">John Birley's</span>
wink and a playful nudge from <span class="smcap">John Birley's</span>
elbow in his left or right side, for <span class="smcap">John</span>
speaks with both elbows. The crafty rogue would there and then
know&mdash;if he were not too fatally crafty for himself as are so many
rogues, or too conceited to realise the humour of the situation,&mdash;that
his little game, whatever it might have been with
<span class="smcap">John Birley</span>, was up, that his schemes were
upset and that to "try it on," any further with
<span class="smcap">John Birley</span> would be utter waste of time
and trouble. That is what <span class="smcap">John Birley's</span>
wink would convey to the rogue. But to the honest man, to the friend,
the wink and nudge assure good comradeship and something rare in store
for him. To the unfortunate and suffering there is another tone to the
wink and nudge, and to these they are full of promise of hope and
help, and act as a fine invigorating tonic.</p>

<p>Such is <span class="smcap">John Birley</span>, whom I meet <i>en
route</i> and who insists upon my stopping with him and showing me
the place. He travels a great deal, he knows everybody and everybody
knows him. No matter what the language of the country may be, no
matter whether he is in France, Germany, Russia, Egypt, India, or
Africa, among cultivated peers, outlandish peasants, or uncouth
savages, <span class="smcap">John Birley</span> invariably makes
himself thoroughly understood, for any deficiency in his acquaintance
with the language he ekes out with a wink and a nudge adapted to the
occasion, and he is sure to obtain exactly what he wants, or an
excellent substitute for it, if the thing itself is not to be had. And
this has always been so. It so happens that he has retired from
business and is now very rich, but long ago when he was working hard,
and struggling too, his manner and method were just the same; he has
never been discouraged, never been discontented, always energetic,
always sanguine, and has elbowed his path for himself through the
crowd, politely, pleasantly, apologising sympathetically for any toes
he may have accidentally trod upon in his onward course, and working
himself well into the front rank by the magic charm of his wink and
nudge. He has pulled some others after him who have clung on to his
coattails, and brought out of the ruck not a few of those on whose
toes, as I have already said, he had pressed rather heavily in
passing.</p>

<p>I know I cannot be in better hands, and he is going to show me
about everywhere within the very few days I can absolutely spare, now
that my cure is finished, my Royat time over, and that I am on my way
back to England, home, and beauty.</p>

<p>He maps out a few excursions. He has taken them all before, long
ago. But, delighted to go over old ground, the greater part of his
pleasure will be found in my enjoyment; for to revisit places
associated with pleasant memories, or with nothing but the remembrance
of their loveliness, their grandeur, or their solemnity, is to him, in
some way like welcoming old friends. All <span class="smcap">John
Birley's</span> friends are old ones; he has no new ones,&mdash;he never
had. Some men of the world discussing him, aver that it is a sort of
proof to themselves of there being something good still left in them,
that they can reckon themselves among <span class="smcap">John
Birley's</span> friends. They are of all shades and colours are his
friends, and they will analyse each other's characters behind each
other's backs in the presence of <span class="smcap">John
Birley</span>, and afterwards they will be more inclined towards each
other, more sympathetic, and more charitably disposed, in consequence
of each other's good points having been brought out into strong relief
by <span class="smcap">John Birley's</span> kindly light. So it is
with seeing the beauties of nature or art in his company; and so it is
that I consider myself to have alighted on my legs in having come
across him in this, the lovely playground of Europe, the home of the
Merry Swiss Boys and Girls.</p>

<p>There is the Lake to be done; there is Nyon, Thonon, Rolle,
Lausanne, Ouchy, Evian-les-Bains, Vevey, and then there are the
heights above, including the ascent to St. Gergues, and to wherever
can be obtained the best views of Mont Blanc, the Dent du Midi, and
the other well-known "objects of interest." Were
<span class="smcap">Puller</span> here, he would say that "the best
views of these mountains can be obtained at the photographers"&mdash;but he
is not here, he is finishing his treatment at Royat. So it is all
arranged, and we dine together, as a commencement.</p>

<p>"You don't mind a third party present?" says
<span class="smcap">Birley</span> to me, apologetically, "as I have
just found old Sir <span class="smcap">Alec McQuincey</span>,
wandering about without a companion. Wretched to be alone, eh? and
not well, eh? Suffering from liver&mdash;nasty that&mdash;gives jaundiced view
of life. So must cheer the old boy up. He's off for a cure to
Evian-les-Bains; so I said to him, 'Dine with us to-night, and we'll
land you there to-morrow, eh?'&mdash;that's right, isn't it?"&mdash;and he gives
me a cheery wink and nudge, taking me, as it were, into partnership
with him in his scheme for entertaining Sir <span class="smcap">Alec
McQuincey</span>, and for keeping up the latter's spirits, previous to
seeing him off to-morrow to the place across the Lake where he is to
undergo his treatment, which I trust may enable him to "live happily
ever after," and enjoy any amount of City dinners ("He is a City
magnate," says <span class="smcap">Birley</span>, with a nudge, "and
that's not good for liver complaint, eh?") till the end of next
Season.</p>

<p>Sir <span class="smcap">Alec</span> is a capital companion, hearty,
cheery, and full of anecdotes. He has got an excellent listener in
<span class="smcap">John Birley</span>, whereat I am rather astonished
as <span class="smcap">John</span> generally has a lot to say for
himself, and a good story from one man invariably draws out another
from J. B. But on this occasion he is so unusually silent that I am
puzzled. It is true that Sir <span class="smcap">Alec</span> commences
most of his anecdotes with an apology to
<span class="smcap">Birley</span> in this shape, "I've told this to
<span class="smcap">Birley</span> before, but," turning to me, "you
haven't heard it, and it may interest <i>you</i>," whereupon
<span class="smcap">Birley</span> nods approval, and I politely assure
Sir <span class="smcap">Alec</span> that I am already deeply
interested by anticipation, and in the words of the ancient drama, now
obsolete, I feel inclined to add, "Proceed, sweet warbler, your story
interests me much; proceed."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>[pg 161]</span></p>

<p>The sweet warbler, who, by the way, is a trifle hoarse and
occasionally a little indistinct, tells several of these
narratives&mdash;they are narratives&mdash;and I cut in with occasional
observations more or less to the point, which are silently
acknowledged by <span class="smcap">Birley</span>, but not by Sir
<span class="smcap">Alec</span>, who seems bent upon getting on with
his series, interspersed with anecdotes, to the exclusion of all other
conversation. He begins with the fish, and his first story about
somebody who rose from nothing and arrived at being something, lasts,
with the assistance of several discursive but illustrative anecdotes,
till we reach the merry Swiss cream and stewed fruit. With the coffee
and cigars he opens volume two of his interesting and remarkable
stories of great men&mdash;each biographical monologue being really
interesting by itself, only taken together they ought to be spread
over a considerable period, like the <i>Arabian Nights'
Entertainments</i>, and still <span class="smcap">Birley</span>
contentedly listens, gently inhaling his cigarette, and, when referred
to, nodding corroboration. It occurs to me that as Sir
<span class="smcap">Alec</span> has told all these before to
<span class="smcap">John Birley</span>, so the latter may have told
most of his to Sir <span class="smcap">Alec</span> and to myself, and
that that is why he is now so silent. At all events, he only rarely
makes observations, and these of the curtest. I fancy he wants me to
come out and amuse Sir <span class="smcap">Alec</span>, in return for
Sir <span class="smcap">Alec</span> interesting me; and it occurs to
me that I shall be ungrateful if I do not cut in with something new,
just to save <span class="smcap">Birley</span> from hearing Sir
<span class="smcap">Alec's</span> stories all over again, and Sir
<span class="smcap">Alec</span> from hearing
<span class="smcap">Birley's</span>, with which I presume, as they are
such very old and intimate friends, he must be acquainted.</p>

<p>So I rouse myself, with a strong determination to shine or perish
in the attempt. I make a sharp and apposite remark on some portions of
the story which Sir <span class="smcap">Alec</span> is now recounting,
whereat <span class="smcap">Birley</span> smiles, and Sir
<span class="smcap">Alec</span> smiles too, but resumes his narrative
at once, as if he were afraid of losing the thread in consequence of
my interruption. I am conscious of having only glimmered; I have not
yet shone. On he goes again; he is telling us of a wonderful silver
tea-pot, how it was lost in a cart, how some one saw it outside the
Old Bailey, how some one came up at that moment and a Judge said to an
Alderman, "That's the tea-pot!" Now at this moment I remember that I
have a story which neither of these two has ever heard of a Judge and
an Alderman which will come in capitally here, and so as I am quite
certain that if I keep it to myself and allow the opportune moment to
pass, I shall forget it entirely, and so lose a magnificent chance of
shining brilliantly in the presence of Sir
<span class="smcap">Alec</span> (who if favourably impressed can be, I
am aware, of the greatest possible service to me), I take advantage of
Sir <span class="smcap">Alec</span> drawing strenuously at the last
half-inch (he is a thrifty man evidently) of his expiring cigar, to
say briskly, "By the way,&mdash;excuse my interrupting you&mdash;but that
reminds me," and then I give my story of the Judge and the Alderman,
which makes <span class="smcap">Birley</span> laugh, and brings a
smile to Sir <span class="smcap">Alec's</span> lips, though it seems
to me there is a puzzled expression on his countenance, as though he
couldn't quite understand the point, and was appearing to be amused
chiefly out of politeness to me as being a friend of
<span class="smcap">John Birley's</span>.</p>

<p>However, Sir <span class="smcap">Alec</span> does smile, and then
forthwith resumes his narrative. When he has finished, as he has
mentioned the names of some persons with whom I am acquainted, I ask
him if they are so and so, and he replies, "Yes," and adds something
which elicits from me a sharp remark that gets a roar from
<span class="smcap">Birley</span>, and produces on Sir
<span class="smcap">Alec's</span> countenance another smile and the
same sort of puzzled expression I had noticed before. I feel that I
have shone, but that somehow I have not turned my light strongly
enough on to Sir <span class="smcap">Alec</span>. I question him as to
the identity of some other celebrated persons he has been mentioning,
and he replies with something about them which doesn't seem to exactly
correspond with my question; but once more&mdash;being in the happiest
vein, and shining in a manner that positively astonishes myself, I let
off another brilliant jest, which is received in precisely the same
manner by my audience as were my previous conversational fireworks. I
think to myself, "I am ingratiating myself with Sir
<span class="smcap">Alec</span>. This will be a first-rate thing for
me and for several members of my family, as a man in Sir
<span class="smcap">Alec's</span> influential position," &amp;c.</p>

<p>Sir <span class="smcap">Alec</span> now starts another subject, and
as I foresee that if he sticks to it, I have something which will cap
everything, I at once question him as to something he has just
uttered. He replies, but, as before, I am bothered by his reply, which
seems to me utterly inconsequent. So I repeat my question. And he
smiles, nods and says, "Well&mdash;yes&mdash;" doubtfully. But my question
required quite a different sort of answer. It had been, "How many
times did you say Lord <span class="smcap">Grangemore</span> sneezed
on that occasion?" To which it is evident that a doubtful
"Well&mdash;um&mdash;yes," is not a satisfactory answer. So I repeat the
question, whereupon he turns towards me confidentially and says, "No,
I don't think so. It was her sister he married." I look at him
inquiringly to see if this is his fun, but at that moment I catch a
wink from <span class="smcap">Birley</span> who is putting up his hand
to his ear and intimating in the clearest possible pantomime for my
private and particular benefit, that our entertaining friend Sir
<span class="smcap">Alec McQuincey</span> is uncommonly deaf!</p>

<p>Now I comprehend <span class="smcap">Birley's</span> silence. Now I
comprehend why Sir <span class="smcap">Alec</span> goes on talking,
and why he looks puzzled at any interruption, and why he could only
smile when he got the cue, as it were, from his companion, and was
made aware that there had been something said which required to be
smiled at.</p>

<p>I relapse into silence. I accept an excellent cigar from Sir
<span class="smcap">Alec</span>, and I let him talk for the rest of
the evening uninterruptedly, until he looks at his watch, says that
nine-thirty is late enough for him, that he has enjoyed his evening
with us amazingly, and goes off to bed.</p>

<p>"Agreeable old chap," says <span class="smcap">Birley</span>,
stretching out his legs, preparatory to taking a short stroll. "Seen a
lot of life has old <span class="smcap">Alec</span>. He's a capital
Chairman at a Board-meeting. Just deaf enough when he doesn't want to
hear any arguments. I let him talk on."</p>

<p>"So I see," I say, and we walk out to bid good-night to Mont
Blanc.</p>

<p>"The Mons looks like a warrior taking his rest&mdash;his last rest,"
says <span class="smcap">Birley</span>, gravely, giving me a subdued
nudge. "<span class="smcap">Napoleon the Great</span>, and his cocked
hat, carved out of white stone. Ah!" and, meditatively we linger, and
then walk slowly back to the Hotel.</p>

<p>"We'll take old <span class="smcap">Alec</span> to his warm bath at
Evian-les-Bains to-morrow," says <span class="smcap">Birley</span>.
"Good night." Then he pauses on the stairs, as with a wink full of
fun, and last playful nudge, he says, "I suppose you'll let him have
all the talk to himself, eh? Won't you? Ha! ha! I shall."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>My friend <span class="smcap">Skurrie</span> to whom his own Plan
of Return, which I have accepted, is as the law of the Medes and
Persians, says he will give me three days more for
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span> and
<span class="smcap">Birley</span>, and that then we must emphatically
start homewards as he insists on <span class="smcap">Jane</span> and
myself seeing Heidelberg <i>en route</i> and every half hour of our
time from Wednesday to Monday is so carefully adjusted that to miss
one train will upset all the plans he has taken such pains and trouble
to arrange for us. I am closeted with him for two hours, when he
explains it all to me, gives me, so to speak, the key of the puzzle,
insists on my verifying the items by <i>Cook's Tourist Train-Book</i>
(an invaluable work), and then reducing it to writing. After this I am
headachey, and exhausted.</p>

<p>[P.S.&mdash;Revising this, long after the event, I say, "Beware of
<span class="smcap">Skurrie</span> and his fixed plan of sight-seeing
against time."]</p>

you, slick out, if you reckon it was all fair and square with that

that race had gone down in a diving-bell the evening before and
screwed themselves on to that yacht would not have surprised me. And,
let me tell you had they done so, they would have considerably impeded
her progress the following day. That Captain
<span class="smcap">Barr</span> was cute enough when he said, "he
couldn't make out what had come to his ship." Take my word what had
come to it was just that diving-bell, and I shouldn't mind calculating
that the owner of the <i>Volunteer</i> was boss of the interested
parties fixed up inside of it. You ask "can such things take place in
the States?" Wal&mdash;I guess they just can. Muchly so, when there's money
on it. As to the diving-bell advantage, I speak feelingly, as I have
assisted over a twenty-mile course in one myself. We were on that
occasion found out at the finish. But it was all straight. The umpire,
whom we had previously squared, and who was above reproach, gave it in
our favour. It's knowing these things, coupled with the fact that I
backed the <i>Thistle</i> for two hundred dollars, that makes me just
throw out these friendly hints to you, Sir, from,</p>

<p>These are hard times, and the oracles of the newspapers teem with
thrifty suggestions. The last advice to the hard-pressed
agriculturists is, to go in for cultivating mushrooms and
blackberries. What a prospect for the country children! Fancy every
mushroom-meadow tabooed to the early rural rambler, and all the
blackberries strictly "preserved," in the sense of partridges, not of
plum-jam. And what a fate for the land of the oak, the apple-tree, the
wheat and the bearded barley, to come down, like tramps and
village-urchins, to fungi and bramble-fruits!</p>

a gentleman of keen intelligence, admirable judgment, and excellent

<p>Sir, last week the Members of the Associated Chamber of Commerce
had the audacity to affirm that every Counsel should be placed in the
same position as any other agent in respect of his legal obligation to
do the best he could for his employer. In other words, these gentlemen
are anxious to prevent Barristers from accepting briefs unless they
are sure of appearing in Court to conduct the cases to which they
refer. Really nothing would be more monstrous! It is alleged, Sir,
that we with a dozen cases in hand cannot do justice to them all! That
we pick and choose, exerting ourselves in those which interest us
most, and confer most distinction upon us, and neglecting the rest!
This is a very old cry, and a very unfair one. I have been for very
many years a Member of the Bar, and can assure yon that, in my own
professional career (which is a typical one), I have never been
guilty of the abuses credited to us. The Representatives of the
Associated Chambers of Commerce can know very little of the matter to
which they are pleased to call attention by their superficial
observations. I should like some of these Representatives to attend
with me in the Royal Courts in Term Time, to mark us as we labour in
the cause of our clients, and then to accompany me to the House of
Commons, to watch us as we attend to our Parliamentary duties. Amongst
our number, I would show him Mr. <span class="smcap">Waddy</span>,
unexhausted from impassioned appeals to the Jury, standing with Blue
Book in hand, ready to use his mighty voice in defence of those
liberties so dear to the heart of every Englishman. And when they were
weary of admiring that gentleman, I would beg of them to regard Mr.
<span class="smcap">Finlay</span>, with his wig off and his gown
discarded, giving gratuitous service to the best interests of the
British Public. Their portraits should be hung up in every Chamber of
Commerce, to remind our detractors that we have souls above fees,
voices beyond the regulation of retainers! Moreover, I feel, Sir, that
those who would attempt to degrade our social status by making us the
peers of the commercial community are as short-sighted as they are
ungrateful. It is said that we throw over our cases&mdash;that we do not
appear when the names of our clients are reached in the Cause List!
Has it ever occurred to these Associated Chambers that as litigation
is admittedly to be avoided, the less law we give the Public the
better? But I will not descend to an argument that should be kept in
reserve when something infinitely stronger will serve my purpose
better. From my name you will see that I can speak with authority. In
that name I solemnly declare that I have never picked and chosen my
cases, but have ever taken in all of them equal interest, and done to
all of them equal justice.</p>

<p>I deny that, by running after <i>me</i>, the Public has been guilty
of an insane action. At least in the sense attached by Mr.
<span class="smcap">Norwood</span> to the accusation. Further, I have
yet to learn that the Public ever <i>has</i> run after me. And if the
Public has run after me, I absolutely and entirely contradict the
absurd statement that it could get much better work done by
others&mdash;<i>at any rate for a third of the money!</i></p>

<p><i>A Secret Inheritance</i> is the title of Mr.

best, Romance, because his others have all been as absorbingly
interesting and as exciting as this. Yet because in this the author

this down as the best of all Mr.

<p>In an admirably got up and well-arranged Jubilee volume about Pope

information which may be advantageously recommended to Emperors,
Empresses, Monarchs of all they survey, Princes, Lord Mayors, and
Aldermen. It is "the Pope's dinner." Listen, "A few minutes suffices
for its consumption." "He does not spend a hundred francs a month for
his table." Not one pound a week! Not three shillings a day on his
food, wine included! He dines "at two o'clock: his mid-day meal lasts
not longer than half-an-hour, and is very frugal, consisting of soup,
one kind of meat, two dishes of vegetables, some fruit, and, by the
doctor's orders, a glass of claret." His supper at 9.30 consists of
"soup, an egg, and some salad." Is there a Radical living who could
tax the Pope's bill of fare as exorbitant?</p>

<p>Az I speek, so I rite, az neerly az possibl. I hope that wunce
popular soshial and intellectual recreashon meeting the "Spelling
Bee," (<i>sic</i>) will soon be revived, with a difference. It may be
expected to cum up agen under the name of a Fonetik Spelling B, and
the auspices of the American Spelling Reform Associashun. A
competishun in spelling English wurds acording to thare sound may
divert superfishl hearers; but no dout menny of those who hav cum to
scoff wil remane to spel.</p>

<p>The adopshun of fonetik spelling must tend to elevate the Masses in
respect of orthografy to a level with the Classes, az it will enable
the former to spel az they speek correctly, when they do speek so.
But, for that matter the fonetik orthografy, wunce adopted, wil
naturally be followd by an adaptashun of all the prezent rules of
Grammer to popular uzage. Perhaps the aspirate wil be expeld from the
Alfabet, and there wil be an end to the supersilius aristocrat's
derizhun of the Peeple for dropping their h's.</p>

<p>However, an Act of Parliament mite be necessary to effect the
rekwisit reforms of the <span class="smcap">Queen's</span> Inglish if
possibl.</p>

<p>If the Republic of Letters cood be persuaded to employ those of the
Alfabet fonetically, a popular system of spelling wood soon prevale.
At leest all ordinary parts of speech mite by common consent be
ritten as pronounsd. But a certin difficulty wood perhaps be prezented
by proper names. I am afrade my friends who spel their own
<span class="smcap">Marjoribanks</span>,

<span class="smcap">DeCrespigny</span>,
<span class="smcap">Dalrymple</span>, and others whom I could mention,
wood almost as soon be hanged as pen fonetik signatures. As for
myself, however, I hav no such objecshun. I happen to inherit a name
of which the tradishonal orthografy is
<span class="smcap">Colquhoun</span>. It is far too much of a mouthful
to be pronounced az so spelt, and I, for my part, deferring all pride
of pedigree to a great intellectual movement, do not hesitate to sine
it, regardless of the double meaning it may convey to an American
reeder,</p>

<p>This wounded buck that is approaching us, painfully dragging its
shattered hind-leg after it, must be the same creature we peppered,
after such good sport, last Tuesday week.</p>

<p>Dear me, I did not know that our hunting-pack consisted of a
mastiff, two poodles, three bull-dogs, a beagle, and a
bloodhound.</p>

<p>Are these clumsy sportsmen, who blaze away without knowing what
they are firing at, the "gentlemen" invited by the Verderer to assist
him at the chase? Ha! I think, from the way he shakes his head as he
makes off, that I must have hit that old buck nearly in the eye.</p>

<p>No, I am mistaken. I can clearly see now from the manner in which
he is limping that I must have wounded the young deer badly in the
ankle.</p>

<p>I wonder whether I shall find him lying down in a copse and dying
some time next week.</p>

<p>My friends will certainly have to wait for their venison, for,
strange to say, that is the seventeenth buck I have maimed this
morning who has managed to drag himself off after being hit.</p>

<p>Fortunately the officers of the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals are engaged in Town.</p>

<p>While this lasts, however, there cannot be a doubt but that the
quality of the sport is excellent.</p>

<h2>A STABLE COMPANION.</h2>

<p>We read in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> of Sept. 30th the following:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">No salary</span>.&mdash;A Widow Lady (39), well
educated but not accomplished, will give her Services as Housekeeper
in return for a comfortable HOME, and to be treated as one of the
family, and the occasional use of a good hack, no need to have carried
a lady before. Thoroughly understands the management of a gentleman's
house, companionable, and ladylike appearance. Superior
references.&mdash;Address, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Is it the comfortable home which has "no need to have carried a
lady before"? or the "family" of which the Advertiser desires to be
one? We should imagine that this very masculine lady would be more
likely to carry the family. Failing answers to her advertisement, she
had better apply to a Circus for a post. "The occasional use of a good
hack" would evidently be instead of salary. But she is much too
modest. Why say she is "not accomplished" when she knows how to break
in a horse? Any Rugby Football Club would give her "the occasional use
of a good <i>hack</i>."</p>

<p>I must say they take <i>rather</i> a matter of course view here of
my engagement. No one would suppose from their manner that there was
anything at all unusual in a match between a Government official and a
confectioner's assistant! <span class="smcap">Louise's</span> Aunt,
indeed, (whether sincerely, or from motives of policy, I hardly know,)
does not conceal her regret that a certain <span class="smcap">Robert
Ponking</span> had not "spoken out" while he had the opportunity.
<span class="smcap">Ponking</span> is a rising salesman in the
trimming department of some upholstering business, and doing, I
understand, extremely well. Still, I do flatter myself&mdash;but one can't

</div>

<p>An encounter&mdash;which, but for <span class="smcap">Louise's</span>
exquisite common sense, might have been awkward&mdash;has just taken place.
We met <span class="smcap">Ponking</span> on the Pier. It struck me
that the Aunt's surprise was a little overdone, but he was evidently
unprepared for <i>me</i>. <span class="smcap">Louise</span> perfectly
composed, however; introduced me as "her intended" (a trifle
<i>bourgeois</i> this, perhaps, but it <i>is</i> difficult to know
what to say&mdash;I felt it myself.) <span class="smcap">Ponking</span>
allowed her to see he was fearfully cut up, and I am afraid she is
reproaching herself a little, poor girl!</p>

<p>We have met him again; he has reached the saturnine and Byronic
stage; <span class="smcap">Louise</span> remonstrated with him for
smoking so many cigars, which she was sure were bad for him
(<i>his</i> cigars are bad for everybody else at all events!) and he
replied gloomily that there was no one to care <i>now</i> what he did,
and oversmoking was as pleasant a way of leaving the world as most. I
can see this is depressing <span class="smcap">Louise</span>; she is
not nearly so bright when alone with me as she used to be&mdash;she does
not even take much interest in my Drama! I do my best to comfort her
by declaring that <span class="smcap">Ponking</span> is only "posing,"
and has not the remotest idea of dying for love; but that only seems
to irritate her&mdash;she has such a tender little heart.</p>

<p>As we are constantly meeting him about, I appeal to him privately
to brighten up a little. He is much affected, says I must make some
allowance for his position, and implores me not to forbid him
<span class="smcap">Louise's</span> society altogether. He will make
an effort to be gayer in the future, he promises me, the mask shall
only be dropped in private. After all, he is
<span class="smcap">Alf's</span> friend, and an especial favourite of
the Aunt's. If he does not recognise the propriety of going, I can't
send him away&mdash;we must see something of him. I should be sorry for him
myself&mdash;if only he were not such an underbred beast!</p>

<p>There is certainly a decided alteration in
<span class="smcap">Ponking</span>; he now affects the most rollicking
high spirits&mdash;though why he should find it necessary to dissemble his
grief by playing the fool all over the sands is more than I can
understand. But he grinds piano-organs, and goes round with the
tambourine; receives penny galvanic shocks, and howls until he
collects a crowd; has "larks" with the lovebirds which pick out
fortunes, and chaffs all the Professors of Phrenology, choosing, as
the head-quarters of his exploits, any place where Louise and I happen
to be, to whom he returns, with roars of laughter, to tell us his
"latest." Then he plays practical jokes on <i>me</i>, chalking things
on my back, and putting sand down my neck. It is all very well for him
to plead that he does these things "to hide an aching heart,"&mdash;but if
he hides it in this way, he won't be able to find it again&mdash;that's
all! I can see, too, it disgusts <span class="smcap">Louise</span>,
who bites her lips a good deal, although, she says, it is "quite a
treat to see how Mr. <span class="smcap">Ponking</span> is enjoying
himself." I am afraid, for all that, that she thinks me a little too
serious. Perhaps I am&mdash;I must prove to her that it is possible to
rollick with refinement. But, somehow, I can never make her laugh as
<span class="smcap">Ponking</span> does.</p>

<p>I very seldom have a quiet hour with her now; her brother has
persuaded her that she ought "to see more of what's going on," and
"do as others do." Her wishes, are, of course, paramount with
me&mdash;although I cannot see the enjoyment of going to the open-air
Music-Hall <i>quite</i> so often, nor did I come here to play "penny
nap," on the sands all the afternoon. If, too,
<span class="smcap">Louise</span> must speculate, she might "go nap"
with more judgment, and I do strongly object to the ostentatious
generosity with which <span class="smcap">Ponking</span> throws away
his best cards, rather than rob her of a trick&mdash;it is in the
<i>worst</i> taste, and yet I fear she is touched by it. In the
evening several of us promenade the town arm in arm;
<span class="smcap">Ponking</span> has a banjo and
<span class="smcap">Alf</span> an accordion.
<span class="smcap">Louise</span> begs me to go, to see that
<span class="smcap">Alf</span> does not get into trouble&mdash;which may be
necessary enough, but who will see that <i>I</i> get into none?</p>

<p>It is unpleasant to be warned by a policeman not to make so much
noise over the "<i>Soy, oh, what Joy</i>," ditty, and I don't know why
he singled <i>me</i> out&mdash;I was only <i>humming</i> the confounded
thing! They generally come in and have supper with me, which Mrs.
<span class="smcap">Surge</span> complains bitterly about; she says
the gentlemen stay so late, and are so noisy, and her room smells of
smoke so next day. I am aware of that, because I have to <i>sit</i> in
it. I don't like <span class="smcap">Ponking</span> at any time, but,
if possible, he is rather more detestable in his sentimental moods,
which generally come upon him after supper, when he informs me that
the 'alo has departed from his life, and begs me, in broken accents,
to allow <span class="smcap">Louise</span> to visit his tomb
occasionally. If he were only <i>there</i>!</p>

<p>To-day <span class="smcap">Louise</span> appeared, for the first
time, in a striped yachting-cap. I merely hinted, very gently, that,
as she had never been on board a yacht in her life, and the cap did
not even suit her, I preferred her ordinary style of head-dress, when
she grew angry at once. <i>Everybody</i>, she informed me, was not of
my opinion&mdash;Mr. <span class="smcap">Ponking</span> had complimented
her particularly&mdash;hang <span class="smcap">Ponking</span>!</p>

<p>I find myself constantly greeting and being greeted by Blazers. I
am sure <i>I</i> don't know how I have come to be acquainted with so
many&mdash;they all ask me "How is myself," and, in answer to my polite,
but scarcely warm, inquiries after their health, reply that they are
"ter-rific"&mdash;which they <i>are</i>! <span class="smcap">Ponking</span>
was asked by <span class="smcap">Louise</span> the other afternoon
whether he was "ready for his tea;" and answered briefly, but
emphatically, "Wait till I get <i>'old</i> of it!"
<span class="smcap">Louise</span> remarked afterwards that he was "so
quick." I doubt very much whether she would say as much of <i>me</i>.
I am as fond of her as ever&mdash;in some respects, fonder&mdash;but I cannot
help noticing these things&mdash;I cannot help seeing that Starmouth is not
doing her any good.</p>

<p><i>Afternoon: on the Sands.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Louise</span>
and <span class="smcap">Alf</span> have been scooping a pit. When it
is dug, she says coquettishly that there is just room for me. I
decline, a little curtly perhaps&mdash;but I really am surprised at
<span class="smcap">Louise</span>&mdash;such extremely bad style! Her
Aunt, who is eating plums hard-by, says "some people seem to think
themselves too grand for anything." I can hear
<span class="smcap">Alf</span> whispering that
<span class="smcap">Louise</span> would not have to ask "poor old
<span class="smcap">Ponk</span>" twice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise</span> says, pouting, that she shall not
ask <i>me</i> again. I can see I have hurt her feelings. After all, it
is possible to be <i>too</i> particular&mdash;there is no harm in
it&mdash;countless couples around us are making themselves at least equally
conspicuous. Somehow I never can be as firm with
<span class="smcap">Louise</span> as I am with most people.... I
<i>ought</i> to be comfortable, with her head resting upon my shoulder
and my arm encircling her waist (<i>she</i> insists on this)&mdash;but, as
a matter of fact, I catch myself remarking how very much
<span class="smcap">Louise</span> has caught the sun of late. And she
has developed quite a <i>twang</i> within the last few days!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ponking</span> has just come up; he has
arranged with a photographer to take us all, just as we are, in a
group. As <span class="smcap">Ponking</span> and
<span class="smcap">Alf</span> consider it humorous to be taken in the
act of making horrible grimaces, we promptly become objects of general
interest. I should <i>not</i> like to be seen by any of the fellows
at the office just now.</p>

<p>We are all posed&mdash;and a nice picture we shall make!&mdash;when, on the
outskirts of the crowd, I see a slender stately figure, which does not
seem quite to belong to Starmouth.</p>

<p>There is actually a sort of resemblance&mdash;but that is absurd! She
notices the crowd, and as she pauses with a half-indifferent
curiosity, I see her full face.... It is almost too terrible to be
true&mdash;but I am under no delusion,&mdash;<i>it is <span class="smcap">Ethel
Dering</span>!</i></p>

<p>"Quite steady all, for one moment, please," says the photographer.
If I could only bury my head in the sand like an ostrich,&mdash;but
<i>that</i> would excite remark, I suppose, and, besides, there is no
time!</p>
